            <p class='title'>About Heriot Watt</p>
            <p class='paragraph'>
                Heriot-Watt University is basically the Hogwarts for engineers and scientists—minus the wands, but with way more lab reports. Founded in 1821 (yeah, before most of your favorite superheroes were even a thought), it has evolved into a global powerhouse with campuses in Edinburgh, Dubai, and Malaysia. Think of it like the multiverse, but for higher education. Whether you're building robots or decoding the secrets of the universe, Heriot-Watt has the vibes of Tony Stark’s workshop with just a bit more rain and a lot more coursework.

            <p class='title'>About MACs</p>
            <p class='paragraph'>
                MACS at Heriot-Watt is where brains meet binary. It's like The Matrix, but you're the one writing the code—and yes, there is a lot of coffee involved. Covering everything from AI to actuarial science, MACS turns students into data-wielding wizards, capable of bending spreadsheets and algorithms to their will (no Infinity Gauntlet required). It’s the place where you go from "Hello, World" to "Hello, Fortune 500" faster than you can say "I’m not a regular programmer, I’m a cool programmer."

            <p class='title'>About Hackathon</p>
            <p class='paragraph'>
                Imagine staying up for 48 hours straight, surviving on pizza, Red Bull, and sheer adrenaline while trying to code something that actually works—that’s a hackathon. It’s like The Hunger Games, but instead of fighting to the death, you're debugging for your life. Teams of sleep-deprived geniuses come together to build apps, solve problems, and meme their way through bugs that should never have existed (looking at you, semicolon). Whether you're hacking the mainframe or just trying not to crash your JavaScript, hackathons are where innovation meets chaos—and somehow, it works.
